<h2> Repositories for application</h2>
<p>https://github.com/Team-Zero-Errors/ims-project-api</p>

<h2>Deployed Sites</h2>

<h2>What technologies were used:</h2>
<ul>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Command Terminal</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>Handlebars</li>
<li>SCSS</li>
<li>AJAX</li>
<li>Google</li>
<li>Stack Overflow</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development Process:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Team worked together on getting the repositories for both client and api up and running</li>
<li>Team of three: Scott Holm, Katherine Ward, Jason Vo</li>
<li>We started out with each person working on a feature. One person worked on the user authentication in the front end, one person set up the handlebars in the front end, and the last person worked on setting up the backend.<li>
<li>Set up handlebars and get the user authentication to work. It was fairly easy since the template already provided user authentication.</li>
<li>Minor style additions to our page, just so it did not look plain. Touch it up later down the development process.</li>
<li>Only needed to add targets and event handlers for sign in, sign out, change password, and sign up.</li>
<li>Created an item folder that will hold the api, events, and ui files.</li>
<li>Added event handlers that will listen to the user actions and base on that action the user will either create item, delete item, show all items, update item.</li>
<li>After the user clicks/submit the button, it will trigger the request for that action in the api. Ui will display the success/failure feedback to the user.</li>
<li>Once everything seems to be working on localhost, we set up for deployment for both api/client to ensure that both are communicating with each other.</li>
